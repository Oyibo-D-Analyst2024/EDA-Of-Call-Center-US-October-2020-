# Call Center Dashboard

### Project Overview
---
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance of cell centers in the month of October 2020
in various cities and states in USA. By analyzing various aspects of the call center data, we seek to identify trends, make
data-driven recommendation, and gain a deeper undesrtanding of the company's performance.

### Data Source
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is "call_center.csv" file containing customer id, customer name, sentiment, csat score
call, call day, reason, city, state, channel, response, time, call duration in minutes and call center columns(field) with a total of 32942 rows(records).

### Tools
- Excel - Data cleaning, data analysis and creating dashboard.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed and they are:
1. Data loading and inspection,
2. Checking for duplicates
3. Inspecting datatypes in each field.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the call center dataset to answer key questions such as:
- What call channel was in high demand?
- What were the customers' lowest-ranking and highest-ranking sentiments?
- What city had more patronage from customers?
- What were the least and most requests of customers?

### Data Analysis
-Pivot tables e.g Calls by sentiment, reason for calls, calls by channel, call center, calls by reponse time, calls by call day, response time by call center, sentiment by call center, response time by call center, calls by call day, calls by state and calls by city.

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Customers made use of call centers more than other channels provided by the company.
2. The lowest-ranking and highest-ranking sentiment of customers were positve and negative respectively.
3. Washington had more patronage from customers than other cities.
4. Customers were more concerned about their billing questions and they were less concerned about payments.

### Limitation
In the dataset, I had to transform the csat_score and call_time_stamp column datatype because there weren't specific and it would have affected our dashboard.
